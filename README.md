## Introduction

This is a hybrid Next.js 16 + Python project demonstrating using NextJS with a FastAPI backend, while still having the benefits of Next.js Route Handlers and Server Side Rendering.

## How It Works

The Python/FastAPI server is mapped into to Next.js app under `/api/`.

This is implemented using [`next.config.js` rewrites](https://github.com/digitros/nextjs-fastapi/blob/main/next.config.js) to map any request to `/api/py/:path*` to the FastAPI API, which is hosted in the `/api` folder.

Also, the app/api routes are available on the same domain, so you can use NextJs Route Handlers and make requests to `/api/...`.

On localhost, the rewrite will be made to the `127.0.0.1:8000` port, which is where the FastAPI server is running.

In production, the FastAPI server is hosted as [Python serverless functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python) on Vercel.

## Deploy Your Own

## Getting Started

First, create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server(python dependencies will be installed automatically here):

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The FastApi server will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).
